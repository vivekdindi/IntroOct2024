# Getting Jeff's Code


0. Have a clone of Jeff's repository on my VM.
1. In your `class` directory, run ` gh repo clone JeffryGonzalez/IntroOct2024 JeffsCode`

Any time you need my code updated:

1. Tell Jeff to Push his code.
2. Dance to the great Salt-N-Pepa song
3. go into `class\jeffscode` directory and run `git pull`

If you want to copy an entire project from Jeff:

1. Close Visual Studio.
2. Either delete or rename your existing project.
3. Copy it from the `JeffsCode` directory into your project (don't move it, copy and paste)
4.
