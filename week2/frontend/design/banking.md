# Banking Feature

When the user navigates (that is a link.) to the Banking feature, there will be an API call that makes a GET
request to the API to get their current balance.

The current balance will be displayed to the user.

We want to allow the user to make deposits to their account, and make withdrawals.

We want the user to see their current "statement", which is a history of all the deposits and withdrawals
they have done over time (more details on this later).
